Circe is a Client for IRC in Emacs                                -*-outline-*-

Project homepage: http://www.nongnu.org/eircc/


* Overview
Circe was initially written in three or four days because the author
got terribly annoyed at bugs in ERC. Nontheless, many ideas are taken
directly from ERC, and that client has served the author well for a
long time. Thanks to all the people who worked on ERC!

It used to be called EIRCC, so don't be confused about that name
occuring from time to time.


* Lui
Circe uses Lui, the Linewise User Interface. This provides many
features with a clean interface so that Circe doesn't have to worry
about the whole displaying stuff. Lui can also be used by other
clients, so that for example the tracking feature is extensible.


* Installation
To install Circe, put all files in a directory, say, ~/.elisp/circe/
Then add the following code to your .emacs:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.elisp/circe/")
  (autoload 'circe "circe" "Connect to an IRC server" t)

Now you can run M-x circe and connect to an IRC server of your choice.

If you use XEmacs, the second line there should read

  (autoload 'circe "circe-xemacs" "Connect to an IRC server" t)


* Sample Configuration
Circe is extensively configurable, and quite well extensible. What
follows is the configuration of the author.


(autoload 'circe "circe" "Connect to an IRC server" t)

(when (file-directory-p "~/.elisp/circe")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.elisp/circe"))

;; This defines the password variables below
(when (file-exists-p "~/.private.el")
  (load-file "~/.private.el"))

(setq circe-default-realname "http://www.forcix.cx/"
      circe-ignore-list nil

                      "#latex" "#ideologies" "##linguistics")
        ("^IRCnet" "#StarWars" "+linux.de"))
      circe-nickserv-passwords `(("freenode" ,freenode-passwd)))

(setq lui-max-buffer-size 30000
      lui-flyspell-p t
      lui-flyspell-alist '(("+linux.de" "german8")
                           ("." "american")))

(eval-after-load "circe"
  '(progn
     (require 'lui-irc-colors)
     (add-to-list 'lui-pre-output-hook 'lui-irc-colors)
     (add-to-list 'circe-receive-message-functions
                  'fc-bitlbee-auth)))

(defun fc-bitlbee-auth (nick user host command args)
  "Authenticate to a bitlbee server."
  (when (and (string= command "JOIN")
             (circe-server-my-nick-p nick))
    (with-circe-server-buffer
      (when (string= circe-server-network "bitlbee")
        (circe-server-send (format "PRIVMSG #bitlbee :identify %s"
                                   bitlbee-passwd))))))

(defun irc ()
  "Connect to IRC."
  (interactive)
  (circe "irc.freenode.net" "6667" "freenode")
  (circe "sarg" "23523" "IRCnet" muh-passwd)
  (circe "localhost" "6668" "bitlbee"))
