;;; Commentary:

;; This Circe modules adds the ability to display various image types when
;; they are linked in a channel. Images are inserted on new lines after
;; the message containing the URLs. This module requires ImageMagcik.

;; To use it, put the following into your .emacs:

;; (require 'circe-display-images)
;; (enable-circe-display-images)

;;; Code:

(require 'circe)
(require 'url)

The keys are urls, and the values are a plist with an `:image-property', and a
`:display-image-p'. `:image-property' is the display property of the image, and
`:display-image-p' is a flag telling us whether the image is currently visible
or not. This map serves to keep track of display transitions, and as a mapping
between the URL and its downloaded image.

Unfortunately we can't map from URL to the image position in the buffer
because 1) the lui library can move text around when executing the
`lui-post-output-hooks' and 2) as we toggle images, that also changes other
images' position in the buffer.")

This function iterates through all display properties in the buffer. We look
for a match with the display property we got from our property map, with the
url-at-point as the key. When we find a match, we either remove or add back
the image. See `circe-display-images-text-property-map' for more details."
