;;; Commentary:

;; tracking.el is a library for other Emacs Lisp programs not useful
;; by itself.

;; The library provides a way to globally register buffers as being
;; modified and scheduled for user review. The user can cycle through
;; the buffers using C-c C-SPC. This is especially useful for buffers
;; that interact with external sources, such as chat clients and
;; similar programs.
